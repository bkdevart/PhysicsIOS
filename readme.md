# Physics Playground
## Overview
An interactive setting to test newtonian physics

## Features
### Shape types
Can switch betwen multiple types of shapes to drop in the environment

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Text
	- Can change fonts
- Data

### Shape size
Can choose size of each object to drop 

- Use sliders for height and width

### Shape modes
Different modes to place objects in the environment:

#### Paint mode
Draw non-physics objects, creating images in the background of the physics playground

#### Pinned mode
Draw a physics object that is not subject to gravity, which will remain where it is placed.

> Other objects can collide with this object, making it ideal for creating platforms and other static elements

#### Pour mode
Repeatedly drops selected objects while touching the screen
> Can result in slowdown depending on the hardware and number of objects dropped

#### Erase mode
Remove objects placed in the physics playground by touching them
